片名: 卑鄙的我2

00:01:33,705 --> 00:01:36,749
最高机密调查实验室 北极圈.

5
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:02,749
Huh?

6
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:18,581
Three weeks, and we're still no closer to cracking this.

7
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:21,577
Right, bring him in!

8
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:22,917
Yes, sir.

9
00:03:42,893 --> 00:03:45,278
艾格尼丝 生日快乐

10
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,278
This is the best party ever!

11
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:05,037
Yeah!

12
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,004
Ha!

13
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:20,562
Oh, no! A dragon is approaching!

14
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:30,144
Fear not, for here come the gallant knights to save us.

15
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:31,189
Yay!

16
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,719
No, no, no. What do you mean she's not coming?

17
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:53,674
I have a backyard full of these little girls

18
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:57,713
who are counting on a visit from a fairy princess.

19
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:00,763
Hurts! Stop it!

20
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:08,730
Listen! I don't want a refund, I want the fairy princess, please!

21
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:11,193
Please, I'm begging you.

22
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:13,689
You know what? I hope that you can sleep at night,

23
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,192
you crusher of little girls' dreams!

24
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,524
Ooh, ooh!

25
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:18,949
When's the fairy princess coming?

26
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:21,575
Any minute now!

27
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,624
Yay!

28
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,407
Stall them!

29
00:05:28,063 --> 00:05:29,662
魔术表演

30
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:30,706
Ooh!

31
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:43,141
Whoa! Whoa, okay! Okay, all right.

32
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:44,969
That's enough of the magic show.

33
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,013
Aw!

34
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:50,275
Wait, did you hear that?

35
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:54,111
It sounded like the twinkling sounds of magical fairy dust.

36
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,563
It's the fairy princess! She's coming!

37
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:58,783
Look!

38
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,622
- Huh? Oh!  - Eh?

39
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:15,082
Ow!

40
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,263
Ow.

41
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:29,984
It is I, Gruzinkerbell,

42
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:34,565
the most magical fairy princess of all!

43
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:38,738
And I am here to wish Princess Agnes

44
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,069
a very happy birthday!

45
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:43,115
How come you're so fat?

46
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,457
Because

47
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:48,164
my house is made of candy,

48
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:52,168
and sometimes I eat instead of facing my problems!

49
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:53,620
How come you have...

50
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,676
Okay, time for cake.

51
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:57,960
Yay!

52
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:04,677
Thank you, Gruzinkerbell! You're the best fairy princess ever!

53
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:08,139
You are welcome, little girl!

54
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:14,271
I know it's really you, Gru. I'm just pretending for the other kids.

55
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:21,903
Hey there, Gru. Mr. Life of the Party!

56
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:23,573
Hello, Jillian.

57
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:26,784
So, I'm gonna go out on a limb here,

58
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:31,621
- but my friend Natalie is recently single, and...  - Oop.

59
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:35,836
No, no, no, get off the limb right now. No limb.

60
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:38,253
Come on, she's a riot!

61
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:41,382
She sings karaoke, she has a lot of free time,

62
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:44,178
looks aren't that important to her...

63
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:48,301
No, Jills, that is not happening. Seriously, I'm fine.

64
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,928
Okay, fine, forget Natalie. How about my cousin Linda?

65
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:52,096
No!

66
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:54,890
Oh! Oh! I know someone whose husband just died...

67
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,111
I'm sorry, I did not see you there.

68
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,482
Or there.

69
00:08:09,284 --> 00:08:11,206
不明物体

70
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:15,206
Kyle? Kyle?

71
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:18,835
Kyle, no! Do not do your business on the petunias!

72
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:19,235
目标锁定

73
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:23,045
There you go. Those are Fred's, go crazy.

74
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,434
Good boy!

75
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:29,758
Mr. Gru?

76
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,178
I didn't... What? Yes?

77
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:35,978
Hi! Agent Lucy Wilde of the AVL.

78
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:39,393
Oh, whoops!

79
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:41,731
Sorry, you're gonna have to come with me.

80
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:44,364
Oh, sorry, I... freeze ray!

81
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,081
You know, you really should announce

82
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:52,124
your weapons after you fire them, Mr. Gru.

83
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:53,795
For example...

84
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,755
Lipstick taser!

85
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,509
Oh, it works so good.

86
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:12,145
Man!

87
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:15,395
Large person.

88
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,823
Oh, sorry.

89
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,869
- Get in there...  - Huh?

90
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,750
you big man!

91
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:39,205
Boss!

92
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:54,720
Uh? Huh!

93
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:00,559
Whoa!

94
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:03,602
Huh?

95
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,240
Ah! Whoo!

96
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:06,941
Ooh!

97
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:27,128
Oh!

98
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,796
Huh? Ah. Quack, quack!

99
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,161
Wow!

100
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,342
What? Where?

101
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,296
Whoa, foot is asleep.

102
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:36,633
Ah, pins and needles!

103
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:39,549
Good afternoon, Mr. Gru.

104
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,717
Eh.

105
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:43,601
I apologize for our methods in getting you here.

106
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,809
I don't. I'd do it again in a heartbeat.

107
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:48,109
I am not gonna lie, I enjoyed that.

108
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,894
Every second of it. Gave me a bit of a buzz, actually.

109
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,651
That's enough, Agent Wilde.

110
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:54,106
Sorry, sir.

111
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,660
Okay, this is bogus!

112
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:59,986
I don't know who you people think you are, but...

113
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:02,408
We are the Anti-Villain League.

114
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:08,042
An ultra-secret organization dedicated to fighting crime on a global scale.

115
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:13,210
Rob a bank, we're not interested. Kill someone, not our deal.

116
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:18,140
But you want to melt the polar ice caps, or vaporize Mount Fuji,

117
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:21,845
or even steal the Moon...

118
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,354
Then we notice.

119
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:27,360
First of all, you got no proof that I did that.

120
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:31,228
Second, after I did do that, I put it back!

121
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:33,192
We're well aware of that, Mr. Gru.

122
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:35,157
That's why we brought you here.

123
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:39,277
I am the League's director, Silas Ramsbottom.

124
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,653
Bottom.

125
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:46,452
Hilarious.

126
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:48,291
Agent Wilde?

127
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:49,794
Oh, me now? Ah.

128
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:51,793
Um, recently, an entire top-secret lab

129
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,759
disappeared from the Arctic Circle.

130
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:57,544
Yeah, the entire lab, just...

131
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,681
gone. Where did it go?

132
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,180
I don't care.

133
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,593
Hmm. The lab was devoted to experiments

134
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:07,144
involving PX-41, a transmutation serum.

135
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:11,232
What is PX-41, you ask? Mmm, it's pretty bad. Look.

136
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:21,862
Ah!

137
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:33,914
Huh, you usually don't see that in bunnies.

138
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:37,959
As you can see, in the wrong hands, the PX-41 serum

139
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,093
could be the most devastating weapon on Earth.

140
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:47,427
Fortunately, it has a very distinct chemical footprint.

141
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:50,477
And using the latest chem-tracking technology,

142
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:53,850
we found traces of it in the Paradise Mall.

143
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,310
A mall?

144
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,815
Precisely. And we believe that one of these

145
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,565
shop owners is a master criminal.

146
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:01,858
And that's where you come in.

147
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:06,321
As an ex-villain, you know how a villain thinks, how a villain acts.

148
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,244
The plan is to set you up undercover

149
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,408
at a shop in the mall, where hopefully we'll be able to...

150
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:13,453
Okay, I see where this is going,

151
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:16,873
with all the Mission: Impossible stuff, but no. No!

152
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:20,669
I'm a father now. And a legitimate businessman.

153
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:24,383
I am developing a line of delicious jams and jellies.

154
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:27,597
"Jams and jellies"?

155
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,929
Oh, attitude! That's right!

156
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,852
So, thanks, but no thanks.

157
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:38,854
And here's a tip. Instead of tasing people and kidnapping them,

158
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:41,358
maybe you should just give them a call!

159
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:43,859
Good day, Mr. Sheepsbutt.

160
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,117
Ramsbottom.

161
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:47,195
Oh, yeah, like that's any better.

162
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,406
Hello.

163
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,256
Look, I probably shouldn't be saying this,

164
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:06,304
but your work as a villain was kind of amazing.

165
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:10,606
So, if you ever wanna get back to doing something awesome,

166
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:13,398
give us a call.

167
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,877
Hey, I told you guys to get to bed.

168
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:36,244
Oh, sorry.

169
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,871
So, when you going on your date?

170
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:39,122
What?

171
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,211
Remember, Miss Jillian said she was arranging a date for you.

172
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:45,344
Yeah, well, she is a nut job, and I'm not going on any date.

173
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:47,598
Why not? Are you scared?

174
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:57,445
Hey, did you guys see the Moon Landing on TV?

175
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,150
Yeah, I can't believe it. It's so cool!

176
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:01,604
Excuse me? Lisa?

177
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:03,146
I was talking to Billy the other day.

178
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,314
No way!

179
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:05,732
He is so cute.

180
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:08,902
Ah. Hey, Lisa, I was wondering if you...

181
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:13,126
Ew! Gru touched Lisa! Gru touched Lisa!

182
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:14,493
Ew!

183
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:16,920
Lisa's got Gruties!

184
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:28,254
Scared? Of what? Women? No! That's bonkers!

185
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:32,479
I just have no interest in going on a date, that's all. Case closed.

186
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:35,732
I'm not scared. Of women. Or dates.

187
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,681
Let's go to bed.

188
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:40,440
Good night, Edith.

189
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:44,229
Good night, Margo. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

190
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,231
Hold the horses. Who are you texting?

191
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:47,822
No one. Just my friend Avery.

192
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:52,821
Avery. Avery? Is that a girl's name or a boy's name?

193
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:54,280
Does it matter?

194
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:57,580
No, no, it doesn't matter unless it's a boy!

195
00:17:57,827 --> 00:17:59,962
I know what makes you a boy.

196
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:01,371
Uh, ooh,

197
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:03,175
you do?

198
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,422
Your bald head.

199
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:08,049
Oh, yes.

200
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,134
It's really smooth.

201
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:13,970
Sometimes I stare at it, and imagine a little chick popping out.

202
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:15,971
Peep peep peep.

203
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:18,899
Good night, Agnes.

204
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:22,146
Never get older.

205
00:18:31,013 --> 00:18:34,899
果酱制作区

206
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,013
Hey, oh!

207
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:00,221
Uh...

208
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,557
Okay, okay.

209
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,226
Hey, Tim, nice haircut!

210
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:39,813
Donnie, hang in there, baby! It's almost Friday.

211
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,722
So, how's today's batch, Dr. Donnie?

212
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,516
I developed a new formula

213
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,818
which allowed me to get every known

214
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:49,279
kind of berry into one flavor of jelly.

215
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:54,448
That tastes good!

216
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,278
I love the flavor of that!

217
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,490
It's horrible, isn't it?

218
00:19:58,656 --> 00:19:59,913
No, no!

219
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:02,786
Oh, we're making great progress!

220
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:04,375
Here, try some of this.

221
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:05,622
Mmm.

222
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:09,710
Ah.

223
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:16,717
Whoa.

224
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:21,853
Okay, just because everybody hates it, doesn't mean it's not good!

225
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:23,734
Listen, Gru.

226
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,479
There's something I've been meaning

227
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,278
to talk to you about for some time now.

228
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:29,155
What? What's wrong?

229
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:30,522
Um...

230
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:34,408
I miss being evil.

231
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:38,707
Sinister plots, large-scale crimes, it's what I live for.

232
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:43,667
I mean, don't you think there's more to our future than jelly?

233
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:47,005
Well, I'm also considering a line of jams.

234
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:50,380
Um, the thing is, Gru,

235
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,756
I've had an offer of employment elsewhere.

236
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:56,254
Dr. Nefario!

237
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,307
Come on, you're kidding, right?

238
00:20:58,466 --> 00:21:00,518
It's a great opportunity for me.

239
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:03,393
Bigger lab, more evil,

240
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,269
full dental.

241
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,148
Very well.

242
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:18,780
Let us give you the proper send-off.

243
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,499
Minions!

244
00:21:24,492 --> 00:21:29,332
The highest honor awarded to Dr. Nefario

245
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:32,261
for your years of service,

246
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:35,798
the 21-fart gun salute!

247
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:47,142
Uh, I counted 22.

248
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,438
Farewell, my friends.

249
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,046
This may take a while.

250
00:22:16,544 --> 00:22:18,631
Go about your business.

251
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:23,479
I miss you already!

252
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:06,184
Huh?

253
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:11,141
Huh.

254
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:20,693
Are you sure we should be doing this?

255
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:22,910
Yes, it's for his own good.

256
00:23:22,793 --> 00:23:24,653
{\An8}"开始约会吧"网站

257
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:25,653
Okay, we need to choose a picture.

258
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:26,828
No.

259
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,331
Scary.

260
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,582
Weird.

261
00:23:30,868 --> 00:23:32,209
What is that?

262
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:35,045
Good morning, girls! I have an announcement to make.

263
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:37,175
Hey, what celebrity do you look like?

264
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:39,254
Uh, Bruce Willis.

265
00:23:40,044 --> 00:23:41,171
Mmm, no.

266
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:42,968
Humpty Dumpty!

267
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:44,591
Ooh, Gollum!

268
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:48,134
Okay, what are you doing?

269
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:50,136
We're signing you up for online dating!

270
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:53,014
Oh, okay. What? No, no, no.

271
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:54,974
Oh, come on. It's fun.

272
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:56,934
And it's time for you to get out there.

273
00:23:56,935 --> 00:24:00,229
No! Stop! No one is ever getting out there! Ever!

274
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:03,524
Oh! Okay, now for the announcement.

275
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:06,027
I have accepted a new job.

276
00:24:06,028 --> 00:24:07,320
Whoa! Really?

277
00:24:07,321 --> 00:24:10,907
Yes, I have been recruited by a top-secret agency

278
00:24:10,908 --> 00:24:13,368
to go undercover and save the world!

279
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:14,786
You're gonna be a spy?

280
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:16,746
That's right, baby!

281
00:24:16,747 --> 00:24:18,706
Gru's back in the game.

282
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:22,502
With gadgets and weapons and cool cars. The whole deal.

283
00:24:22,503 --> 00:24:23,711
Awesome!

284
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:25,931
Are you really gonna save the world?

285
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:29,555
Yes. Yes, I am.

286
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:54,285
Ah!

287
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,008
Hmm.

288
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:04,465
"Bake My Day."

289
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:06,297
Blech.

290
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:18,772
All right, here is the cupcake recipe I got off the Internet.

291
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,697
And don't go nuts with the sprinkles!

292
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:48,629
Whoo.

293
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:51,644
I wasn't expecting that. Or was I?

294
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:55,683
Ooh. You got... you got a little...

295
00:25:58,182 --> 00:25:59,938
Here, I'll get it.

296
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,392
Oh.

297
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,060
It's just spreading.

298
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:05,438
All right, all right. I got it! Stop it!

299
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:06,981
Oh.

300
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:08,026
I'll let you get it.

301
00:26:10,194 --> 00:26:11,986
Yeah, what you just saw there was a little

302
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:13,738
something new I've been working on.

303
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:17,742
It's a combination of Jujitsu, Krav Maga, Aztec warfare

304
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:19,582
and krumping.

305
00:26:20,037 --> 00:26:22,830
Okay, that's weird. Why are you here?

306
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:25,465
On assignment from Silas. I'm your new partner.

307
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:26,795
Yay!

308
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:29,629
What? No, no "yay".

309
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:32,423
Ramsbottom didn't say anything about a partner.

310
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,425
Well, it seems that because of your checkered past,

311
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,260
everyone else refused to work with you.

312
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:38,646
But not me. I stepped up.

313
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:42,234
And I'm new, so I kind of have to do what they tell me anyway.

314
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:43,812
Walla!

315
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:47,315
Ya!

316
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:48,566
Aah!

317
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:50,525
Do you know this guy?

318
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:52,531
Yes, he's one of my minions.

319
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:54,493
Oh, I'm sorry.

320
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:56,578
I should have known.

321
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,413
You are free to go.

322
00:27:03,831 --> 00:27:06,844
Uh? Ah!

323
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:15,176
Kampai!

324
00:27:29,857 --> 00:27:31,023
Oh!

325
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:32,068
Dave...

326
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,444
Earth to Dave!

327
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:36,489
Huh?

328
00:27:36,697 --> 00:27:38,322
You can leave now.

329
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,742
Oh, uh...

330
00:27:46,874 --> 00:27:49,210
So, what do we got? Who's on the list?

331
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:50,628
Fire them at me.

332
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:53,179
First suspect, Hedda Blumentoft,

333
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:55,758
proprietor of Mum's the Word Floral Shop.

334
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:57,597
No, not her.

335
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:59,385
Okay, moving on...

336
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:02,186
Chuck Kinney, owner of Stuff-A-Bear.

337
00:28:04,308 --> 00:28:05,351
Ooh.

338
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:06,728
I don't think so.

339
00:28:07,311 --> 00:28:08,604
Hello?

340
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,526
Buenos días, my friends!

341
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:17,279
I am Eduardo Perez,

342
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:20,708
owner of Salsay Salsa restaurant, across the mall.

343
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:23,796
Now open for breakfast. And you are?

344
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:26,716
Gru. And this is Lucy. And we are closed.

345
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:28,959
This is just going to take un momento.

346
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:31,544
I am throwing a big Cinco de Mayo party,

347
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:35,796
and I am going to need 200 of your best cupcakes

348
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:39,717
decorated with the Mexican flag.

349
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:41,510
It looks something like this.

350
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:44,442
What do you think?

351
00:28:44,598 --> 00:28:46,474
- Ooh.  - Oh.

352
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:47,683
Look away!

353
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:48,809
You, whoo.

354
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:53,858
Anyway, I have to go. It's all settled. I'll pick them up next week!

355
00:28:54,024 --> 00:28:57,867
Have a good day. Come by if you get a chance, okay?

356
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:04,620
And welcome to the mall family.

357
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:13,632
El Macho.

358
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:15,252
What?

359
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:16,504
But it couldn't be.

360
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:18,058
What? What couldn't be?

361
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:24,720
That guy looks exactly like a villain named El Macho.

362
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:26,608
From about 20 years ago.

363
00:29:32,646 --> 00:29:34,117
He was ruthless!

364
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:35,744
He was dangerous.

365
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:39,826
And as the name implies, very macho.

366
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:55,044
He had a reputation for pulling off heists using only his bare hands!

367
00:29:57,129 --> 00:30:02,218
But sadly, like all the greats, El Macho was gone too soon.

368
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:05,678
He died in the most macho way possible.

369
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,513
Riding a shark

370
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:11,773
with 250 pounds of dynamite strapped to his chest

371
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:15,945
into the mouth of an active volcano!

372
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,037
It was glorious.

373
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:25,247
Yeah, sounds like El Macho's pretty dead.

374
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:27,827
They never found the body. Oh, no.

375
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:33,166
All that was ever retrieved was a pile of singed chest hair.

376
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:36,879
But that face! It has got to be El Macho!

377
00:30:37,461 --> 00:30:41,304
Then what do you say you and I break into his restaurant? Tonight?

378
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:44,175
Yes, that's good, because I am telling you,

379
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:48,435
if anybody in this place has the PX-41 serum,

380
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:50,651
it's him.

381
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:56,979
All right, all right, homework done, pajamas on, teeth brushed, time for bed.

382
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,238
What's the big hurry?

383
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:00,357
I just have a lot of work to do.

384
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:02,318
Work, what kind of work?

385
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:04,111
Very important business.

386
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:06,030
So, hugs, kisses.

387
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:08,908
Good night, sleep tight, don't let the bedbugs blah-blah-blah.

388
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:10,034
Whoa!

389
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:11,755
But you said you'd help me practice

390
00:31:11,912 --> 00:31:13,632
my part for the Mother's Day show.

391
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:18,303
Fine, fine. Let me hear it. Quickly.

392
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:22,222
She kisses my boo-boos, she braids my hair.

393
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:25,264
My mother is beyond compare.

394
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:28,308
We love you, mothers, everywhere.

395
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:31,693
Wow! That was something else.

396
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:34,814
I really liked the way you smiled at the end.

397
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:36,982
Let's try this one more time,

398
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:42,316
but a teensy bit less like a zombie, okay?

399
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:43,442
Okay.

400
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:46,570
She kisses my boo-boos, she braids my hair...

401
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:48,447
Perfect! Time to go.

402
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:51,075
I don't think I should do this.

403
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:53,452
Well, what do you mean? Why not?

404
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:55,174
I don't even have a mom.

405
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:58,749
Well, you don't need one to do the show.

406
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,838
I mean, you did the Veterans Day Pageant

407
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:03,138
and you haven't been in combat.

408
00:32:04,131 --> 00:32:05,602
This is different.

409
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:10,681
Okay, well, then maybe you can just use your imagination.

410
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:13,568
You mean I pretend I have a mom?

411
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:16,642
Yes, right? You can do that, can't you?

412
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:18,853
Yeah! I do that all the time.

413
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:20,241
Thanks, Gru!

414
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:26,069
Hey!

415
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:54,179
All right. Hey, hey, no, no! No.

416
00:32:54,181 --> 00:32:56,473
Hey. Hey, please.

417
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:59,727
Kevin, Jerry, watch the girls for me, okay?

418
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:03,109
Dave, Stuart, come this way! With me! Come on!

419
00:33:05,734 --> 00:33:07,151
Come on!

420
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:08,196
Mmm-mmm!

421
00:33:38,225 --> 00:33:39,268
Oh!

422
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:43,022
Mmm-hmm.

423
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:47,818
Huh?

424
00:33:53,615 --> 00:33:55,702
- Oca!  - Oca!

425
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:13,636
Looka too!

426
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:19,934
Huh?

427
00:34:48,775 --> 00:34:52,810
莎莎舞餐厅

428
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:03,396
We're stealth ninjas. We make no sound.

429
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,731
Right. Gotcha.

430
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:08,444
Ya!

431
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:13,152
All right, El Macho. You're going down.

432
00:35:13,153 --> 00:35:15,205
- Wait! Wait.  - What?

433
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:18,032
What are you doing?

434
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:20,666
I'm checking for laser beam alarm triggers.

435
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:23,245
It's a restaurant!

436
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:24,913
You never know what kind of booby traps

437
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:26,540
this guy could have set. Huh? Come on.

438
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:28,961
There are no booby traps.

439
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:31,683
Ha! Booby!

440
00:35:43,183 --> 00:35:44,606
Oh. There's a chicken.

441
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:47,022
Are you lost, little guy?

442
00:35:47,187 --> 00:35:49,073
You must be lost.

443
00:35:49,189 --> 00:35:51,106
Ha! Some guard dog.

444
00:35:55,612 --> 00:35:57,831
Get it off of me! Get it off of me!

445
00:35:58,323 --> 00:35:59,415
Aah!

446
00:36:05,372 --> 00:36:07,044
I got you!

447
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:13,219
I got it!

448
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:22,980
Ha!

449
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:26,185
Oh!

450
00:36:32,482 --> 00:36:34,950
What is wrong with that chicken?

451
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:39,122
Hey, that pollo is loco.

452
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:41,448
No?

453
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:43,086
Okay, let's go.

454
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:51,965
Are you getting anything?

455
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:53,794
No, not yet.

456
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:57,556
But, hey, maybe you can find something with these X-ray goggles.

457
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:00,553
Bah.

458
00:37:05,432 --> 00:37:07,766
How are they working? Tell me! Tell me!

459
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:09,226
Aah! Oof!

460
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:10,894
What's wrong? Is something wrong?

461
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:14,241
That's an image I'll never get out of my brain. Blech!

462
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:24,366
I knew it!

463
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:26,285
The serum is in here!

464
00:37:26,286 --> 00:37:27,661
Ooh, then let's get it.

465
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:32,124
This is going to be good!

466
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:33,169
Ah.

467
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:38,466
Ah-ha!

468
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:39,890
What?

469
00:37:39,926 --> 00:37:41,626
辣酱

470
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,314
Salsa?

471
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:45,065
Aw, man.

472
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:47,683
Oh.

473
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:54,612
Somebody's going to die tonight.

474
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:00,952
Pollito!

475
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:04,448
What did they do to you? Pollito? Can you hear me?

476
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:09,077
Who would do this to such a sweet little chicken?

477
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:11,079
What? Who's there?

478
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,165
Mmm-mmm.

479
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,760
You coming out? Or am I gonna go in?

480
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:21,519
Yah!

481
00:38:22,759 --> 00:38:23,803
Huh?

482
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:26,053
Stop!

483
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:27,857
My eyes!

484
00:38:29,516 --> 00:38:31,437
Gru, call one of your munchkins!

485
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:33,852
We've been spotted! Come get us!

486
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:35,562
Huh? Hey!

487
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:36,773
Ah!

488
00:38:46,783 --> 00:38:48,040
Hmm, subtle.

489
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,299
Over here! Over here!

490
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:56,011
Over...

491
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,259
here.

492
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,308
Hold tight!

493
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:10,182
Aah!

494
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:18,481
I have you now!

495
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:55,563
Yay! Ice cream!

496
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:58,105
Huh?

497
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:18,634
Huh?

498
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:54,796
All right, there he is.

499
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:57,836
Suspect number eight, Floyd Eaglesan.

500
00:40:57,997 --> 00:40:59,468
Oh, okay.

501
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:01,629
See if you can get closer. Go, go.

502
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,191
All right.

503
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:15,432
What the...

504
00:41:15,688 --> 00:41:18,731
{\An8}警告:巨烫无比!

505
00:41:16,766 --> 00:41:18,736
Oh, no. That's not good.

506
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:21,686
Whoa!

507
00:41:21,688 --> 00:41:22,731
Hey, uh, what?

508
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:26,193
Oh!

509
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:32,036
Hey, Gru!

510
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,658
Oh, girls! What are you doing here?

511
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:36,628
Well, we thought we'd come visit you at work.

512
00:41:36,786 --> 00:41:39,467
So, you're saving the world in a garbage can?

513
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:42,124
Funny.

514
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:43,964
Hey! There you are.

515
00:41:44,127 --> 00:41:45,384
Oh. Who's this?

516
00:41:45,545 --> 00:41:49,602
Lucy, these are my girls, Margo, Edith and Agnes.

517
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:52,521
Girls, Lucy. Lucy, girls.

518
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:54,516
- Hello.  - Hi.

519
00:42:02,979 --> 00:42:04,450
Are you single?

520
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:06,731
Oh! Goodness.

521
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:10,825
Oh, hey! I have an idea. Since Lucy and I have lots of work to do,

522
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:13,621
- why don't you girls go and explore the mall?  - Bye!

523
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:16,950
Here is some money, go buy some useless mall junk.

524
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:18,618
Some headbands and...

525
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:20,245
Are you gonna marry Lucy?

526
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:24,126
Are you out of your gourd? No! She just works with me.

527
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:25,633
Plus, you love her.

528
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:28,511
You love her! You love her! You really, really love her!

529
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:29,921
And you're gonna get married!

530
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:31,089
Okay, stop. This is a song of lies.

531
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,257
And I will be the flower girl!

532
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:34,384
I don't even like her. Now, go have fun!

533
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:38,472
Almost forgot. Hugs!

534
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:40,056
Good luck saving the world. Bye.

535
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:41,268
Bye, Gru!

536
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:49,065
Kids, right? They're funny.

537
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:51,109
Those girls totally adore you.

538
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,866
I bet you're a fun dad.

539
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:54,696
Huh.

540
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:56,619
I am pretty fun.

541
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:07,096
Is that stealing?

542
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:10,009
Not if my wish was that I would get a lot of free coins.

543
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,081
Whoa!

544
00:43:41,244 --> 00:43:42,750
Cool glasses.

545
00:43:42,954 --> 00:43:43,997
Oh.

546
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:46,177
I'm Antonio.

547
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:48,302
I'm Margo.

548
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:52,128
I was just going to get a cookie. Care to join me?

549
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:53,885
Uh, sure.

550
00:43:54,507 --> 00:43:56,844
I'm Margo.

551
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:07,102
Um, I'll catch up with you guys later.

552
00:44:07,103 --> 00:44:08,360
Bye!

553
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:12,649
Can I be the first to say, "Ew!"

554
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,536
We gotta go tell Gru!

555
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:17,536
鹰发俱乐部

556
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,830
All right, I'm going in.

557
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:24,035
If it picks up any traces of the serum, the sensor in your belt buckle

558
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:25,495
will make a sound like this...

559
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:26,830
Mee-maw! Mee-maw!

560
00:44:26,831 --> 00:44:27,956
- Mee-maw! Mee-maw!  - Okay!

561
00:44:27,957 --> 00:44:29,796
I get it. I get it.

562
00:44:36,591 --> 00:44:40,019
Welcome to Eagle Hair Club.

563
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:42,687
It's about time you showed up,

564
00:44:42,847 --> 00:44:44,222
Mr. Gru.

565
00:44:45,433 --> 00:44:47,434
You know my name?

566
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:51,990
When someone moves into the mall who is folically-challenged,

567
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:55,653
I make it my business to know all about them.

568
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:58,452
You are bald, and that is bad.

569
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:01,287
There you go, my sweet.

570
00:45:01,741 --> 00:45:03,366
I'm getting nothing so far.

571
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:05,004
I think you need to move around.

572
00:45:12,752 --> 00:45:15,469
Wow, this looks interesting. What is it?

573
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:17,136
I take it you're an art lover?

574
00:45:17,298 --> 00:45:18,423
No serum.

575
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:19,635
Yeah, not so much.

576
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:26,394
Oh, how about this impressive trinket?

577
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:28,391
I'd hardly call it a trinket, Mr. Gru.

578
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:29,976
- Nothing.  - The International...

579
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:31,104
Yeah, I don't care.

580
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:38,360
Mee-maw! Mee-maw!

581
00:45:38,361 --> 00:45:40,904
Hold on, I'm picking up something. Behind that wall!

582
00:45:40,905 --> 00:45:42,614
Ah, and what do we have here?

583
00:45:42,615 --> 00:45:45,950
These are my trial wigs. You should take one.

584
00:45:45,952 --> 00:45:49,329
No, thanks. So, what's on the other side of the wall?

585
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:50,664
Here you are! Look at me! Focus!

586
00:45:50,665 --> 00:45:51,956
Gru?

587
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:56,544
I promise that this wig will transform you from ugly

588
00:45:56,545 --> 00:45:59,594
to irresistible.

589
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:01,966
Margo has a boyfriend!

590
00:46:01,968 --> 00:46:04,052
And they're going on a date!

591
00:46:04,053 --> 00:46:05,470
Date? Boyfriend?

592
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:06,682
What?

593
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:20,237
There she goes!

594
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:34,009
Oh, you're so funny.

595
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:35,375
Gross!

596
00:46:35,376 --> 00:46:37,544
- Look, they're in love.  - Oh, no, no, no.

597
00:46:37,545 --> 00:46:40,004
Do not say that. No, no, no.

598
00:46:40,006 --> 00:46:44,426
And my dream is to one day play video games for a living.

599
00:46:44,427 --> 00:46:46,219
Wow.

600
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:48,388
You're so complicated.

601
00:46:48,389 --> 00:46:50,056
Margo.

602
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:51,694
What is going on here?

603
00:46:52,393 --> 00:46:56,604
Oh, Gru, se llama Antonio. Me llamo Margo.

604
00:46:56,605 --> 00:46:59,951
Me llama-lama ding-dong. Who cares? Let's go.

605
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,284
Whoa!

606
00:47:30,723 --> 00:47:32,479
Kids eat free on Tuesdays.

607
00:47:42,485 --> 00:47:43,528
Yay, Pop!

608
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:45,618
That's awesome!

609
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:51,242
- So good to see you again, mi compadre!  - Ha! Yeah.

610
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:53,711
Oh, I see you have already met my father.

611
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:56,039
What? Father?

612
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:59,542
Si. Look at this crazy small world we live in, eh?

613
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:01,628
Come, sit, let me get you something.

614
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:05,465
- Oh, look at you.  - Heh?

615
00:48:06,926 --> 00:48:09,844
He likes me.

616
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:13,807
Oh, oh! I'm sorry. Pollito is usually very friendly.

617
00:48:13,808 --> 00:48:15,398
He had a rough night.

618
00:48:18,938 --> 00:48:21,731
Well, we really should be going. Girls, come on.

619
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:23,608
That is a pity.

620
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:26,402
Young love is beautiful, no?

621
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:27,779
No!

622
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:31,327
You know, they're not in love. They hardly know each other.

623
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:34,378
You are right, Cabeza de huevo.

624
00:48:34,537 --> 00:48:36,830
They must get to know each other better!

625
00:48:36,831 --> 00:48:41,000
Antonio, why don't you invite your girlfriend and her family

626
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:42,710
to our Cinco de Mayo party?

627
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:44,003
No, no.

628
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:45,096
Si!

629
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:02,146
I'm sorry, El Macho?

630
00:49:02,148 --> 00:49:04,153
Hadn't we eliminated him as a suspect

631
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:06,401
after the whole salsa incident?

632
00:49:06,402 --> 00:49:08,987
Yes, but there has been a new development,

633
00:49:08,988 --> 00:49:12,156
and I'm telling you, this is the guy.

634
00:49:12,158 --> 00:49:14,659
You need to arrest him immediately.

635
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:18,246
And his deviously charming son!

636
00:49:18,247 --> 00:49:21,249
I'm pretty sure that the son is involved, too.

637
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:23,931
The son, also! You got to get the son!

638
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:27,672
I think that the son is the mastermind!

639
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:29,643
There's a look, there's a devilish look

640
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,885
in his eyes, and I don't like it!

641
00:49:31,886 --> 00:49:34,095
Yes, but I don't really see any evidence.

642
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:35,930
Evidence, schmevidence. I go with my gut,

643
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:39,684
and my gut tells me that this guy is El Macho.

644
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:42,270
Lock him up, lock up the son.

645
00:49:42,271 --> 00:49:46,198
Don't forget about the son. The kid gives me the creeps!

646
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:48,363
Oh, dear, dear, dear.

647
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:53,451
But, on the less crazy side of things,

648
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:56,838
Gru discovered traces of the serum at Eagle Hair Club!

649
00:49:57,411 --> 00:49:59,162
Hmm, interesting.

650
00:49:59,163 --> 00:50:01,456
Yeah! And you know who made that happen? Huh?

651
00:50:01,457 --> 00:50:04,834
This guy. Nailed it. Amazing, right?

652
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:08,713
No, I mean, sure. But it's not him, it is El Macho!

653
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:10,757
Mr. Gru, please!

654
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:13,605
No! It is him, and I will prove it!

655
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:17,350
Gru, come on!

656
00:50:19,934 --> 00:50:22,104
He really thinks it's El Macho.

657
00:50:22,937 --> 00:50:24,324
Can you tell?

658
00:50:48,837 --> 00:50:50,474
Oh. Whoo!

659
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:28,842
Give me that!

660
00:51:31,584 --> 00:51:34,842
坏蛋网

661
00:51:34,884 --> 00:51:36,842
连接中断

662
00:51:36,969 --> 00:51:39,899
Kevin, the Wi-Fi's out!

663
00:51:40,264 --> 00:51:41,817
Kevin?

664
00:51:41,974 --> 00:51:44,642
Hey, Lance, where the heck is Kevin?

665
00:51:45,811 --> 00:51:50,314
All right, we need to revisit the number of vacation days you guys get.

666
00:51:50,316 --> 00:51:52,700
I can't find anybody anymore.

667
00:51:53,402 --> 00:51:55,454
Gru, it's Jillian!

668
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:58,328
I've got good news!

669
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:00,626
I have my friend Shannon here with me.

670
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:02,994
I was thinking you two could get some grub.

671
00:52:02,995 --> 00:52:06,293
You know, tear it up, see what happens!

672
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:08,124
Open up!

673
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:09,292
La, la, la, la, la, la, la...

674
00:52:09,293 --> 00:52:12,757
Agnes! Agnes, tell Jillian I'm not here.

675
00:52:13,005 --> 00:52:14,505
Gru's not here.

676
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:16,340
Are you sure?

677
00:52:16,342 --> 00:52:17,925
Yes, he just told me!

678
00:52:19,053 --> 00:52:20,096
Mmm-mmm!

679
00:52:20,346 --> 00:52:22,305
I mean, no, he didn't just tell me.

680
00:52:23,474 --> 00:52:25,728
Agnes, where is Gru?

681
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:29,024
He's putting on lipstick!

682
00:52:30,272 --> 00:52:31,909
He's swatting at flies!

683
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:33,151
No! No!

684
00:52:33,317 --> 00:52:34,740
He's chopping his head off!

685
00:52:36,737 --> 00:52:39,157
He's pooping?

686
00:52:39,907 --> 00:52:41,912
I know you're in there, Gru!

687
00:52:42,076 --> 00:52:45,539
There's no way you're getting out of this!

688
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:54,170
I have to tell you, I was so nervous about tonight.

689
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:57,386
I mean there's just so many phonies out there!

690
00:52:58,050 --> 00:53:00,933
Yes, I hear you.

691
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:03,513
Oh, so, do you work out?

692
00:53:03,514 --> 00:53:04,680
Well...

693
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:07,565
I mean, obviously, you don't, but would you consider it?

694
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:11,395
Huh? Physical fitness is very important to Shannon.

695
00:53:11,397 --> 00:53:13,199
As you can tell, right? Huh?

696
00:53:14,358 --> 00:53:15,525
Ah.

697
00:53:15,526 --> 00:53:16,776
I can tell.

698
00:53:16,777 --> 00:53:17,985
Solid.

699
00:53:17,986 --> 00:53:20,572
We are in the restaurant, you know.

700
00:53:22,533 --> 00:53:24,117
- Hi.  - Takeout for Lucy?

701
00:53:24,118 --> 00:53:25,624
Sure, just a sec.

702
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:40,967
Your accent is so exotic.

703
00:53:40,968 --> 00:53:43,261
Ah. Well, thank you very much.

704
00:53:43,262 --> 00:53:45,012
I know someone who can fix that for you.

705
00:53:45,013 --> 00:53:47,778
And you'll be talking normal in no time!

706
00:53:50,144 --> 00:53:52,362
Whoo. Is it hot in here?

707
00:53:54,273 --> 00:53:56,076
How's the food?

708
00:53:57,109 --> 00:54:00,862
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Are you wearing a wig?

709
00:54:00,863 --> 00:54:01,990
What?

710
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:04,157
Ah! I don't think so.

711
00:54:04,158 --> 00:54:05,449
I knew it.

712
00:54:05,451 --> 00:54:07,743
You're a phony. I hate phonies!

713
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:09,996
Oh, what? No. These locks are all mine.

714
00:54:09,997 --> 00:54:11,372
No, they're not!

715
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:14,584
You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna rip that thing off your head,

716
00:54:14,585 --> 00:54:17,545
and show everyone what a bald-headed phony you are.

717
00:54:17,546 --> 00:54:18,757
I don't think so, Miss Lady.

718
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:29,849
Hello?

719
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:31,267
Hello? Are you...

720
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:32,602
Hey, Gru.

721
00:54:32,603 --> 00:54:35,813
Hello, Lucy. How are you doing?

722
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:38,316
Wow, looks like your date's out for the count.

723
00:54:38,317 --> 00:54:41,402
It's like she's been shot with a mild moose tranquilizer.

724
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:50,119
Yeah, I'm winking because that's what actually happened.

725
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:53,372
Scusi, what's happening here? She no like?

726
00:54:53,373 --> 00:54:54,797
Oh, she's just, uh...

727
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:57,627
Oh, ho.

728
00:54:57,628 --> 00:54:59,629
Sì, Sì. Sì.

729
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:01,101
Shall we take her home?

730
00:55:12,226 --> 00:55:13,269
Oh!

731
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:46,977
Well, I think you did it. You just officially had the worst date ever.

732
00:55:47,261 --> 00:55:48,648
Huh, tell me about it.

733
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:52,306
Don't worry. It can only get better from here, right?

734
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:54,517
But if it doesn't, you can always borrow my dart gun.

735
00:55:54,518 --> 00:55:56,902
I've had to use it on one or two dates myself.

736
00:55:57,104 --> 00:55:59,323
Yeah, you know, as far as dates go,

737
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:01,700
I think I'm good with just the one.

738
00:56:05,529 --> 00:56:08,542
Well, good night, partner.

739
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:12,201
This was fun.

740
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:15,050
Yes. Surprisingly, it was.

741
00:56:15,539 --> 00:56:17,840
Oh, and, uh, just between you and me?

742
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:20,428
You look much better bald.

743
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:24,303
See you tomorrow.

744
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:35,182
Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack!

745
00:56:40,606 --> 00:56:41,897
Yay!

746
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:43,607
So, I take it the date went well?

747
00:56:43,609 --> 00:56:45,863
No, it was horrible.

748
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:59,048
High-five!

749
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:01,251
Bump it.

750
00:57:43,502 --> 00:57:45,305
Mr. Ramsbottom?

751
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:46,754
Oh, hello.

752
00:57:46,755 --> 00:57:48,214
What are you doing here?

753
00:57:48,215 --> 00:57:50,184
- We got him.  - Got who?

754
00:57:50,342 --> 00:57:51,895
Floyd Eaglesan!

755
00:57:52,052 --> 00:57:55,096
Our agents located a secret room in his shop last night

756
00:57:55,097 --> 00:57:56,972
and discovered this.

757
00:57:56,973 --> 00:58:01,066
It's empty, but we found traces of the PX-41 serum in it.

758
00:58:01,228 --> 00:58:02,645
He's our man.

759
00:58:02,646 --> 00:58:06,988
So, somehow, in spite of your incompetence, we solved this one.

760
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:08,776
I was framed!

761
00:58:08,777 --> 00:58:10,528
You won't get away with this!

762
00:58:10,529 --> 00:58:13,155
Get your mitts off of me! I am a legitimate businessman.

763
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:16,992
Ah. All right. So what now?

764
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:20,090
Well, now you're free to go back to your business.

765
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:22,549
Mmm. Jams and jellies.

766
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:24,671
And it looks like Agent Wilde will be

767
00:58:24,835 --> 00:58:26,756
transferring to our Australian branch.

768
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:28,596
Australia?

769
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:29,882
Yes.

770
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:31,882
But thank you for everything.

771
00:58:31,883 --> 00:58:34,802
And by everything, of course I mean nothing.

772
00:58:34,803 --> 00:58:37,389
Toodle pip and cheerio, Mr. Gru.

773
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:44,186
- Hey, there.  - Hey.

774
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:45,688
So, we got him.

775
00:58:45,689 --> 00:58:48,858
Yay. That's great.

776
00:58:48,859 --> 00:58:50,776
And now you're going to Australia?

777
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:53,654
Well, it's not definite yet. I'm still figuring it out.

778
00:58:53,655 --> 00:58:55,865
I've already been working on my accent.

779
00:58:55,866 --> 00:58:58,117
Wallaby. Didgeridoo.

780
00:58:58,118 --> 00:59:00,835
Hugh Jackman.

781
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:04,586
So, um... pretty excited.

782
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:07,168
Great.

783
00:59:07,169 --> 00:59:09,628
Well, good luck.

784
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:12,394
Thanks. You, too.

785
00:59:13,175 --> 00:59:16,051
Oh! Here. I wanted to give you this.

786
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:17,928
Your lipstick taser?

787
00:59:17,929 --> 00:59:19,930
Yeah, it's just a memento.

788
00:59:19,931 --> 00:59:23,942
Just, you know, from the first time we met.

789
00:59:24,186 --> 00:59:26,321
Oh. Thank you, Lucy.

790
00:59:27,189 --> 00:59:28,660
Agent Wilde.

791
00:59:29,149 --> 00:59:32,359
Well, it looks like they need you, so...

792
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:35,125
Yeah, I better go.

793
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:37,627
Bye, Gru.

794
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:16,080
I brought you an umbrella.

795
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:21,116
Ah, thank you.

796
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:22,708
What are you doing out here?

797
01:00:23,286 --> 01:00:27,379
Remember when you said that I liked Lucy?

798
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:31,008
Well, it turns out,

799
01:00:31,169 --> 01:00:32,427
you're right.

800
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:34,221
Really?

801
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:35,810
Yes, but...

802
01:00:36,341 --> 01:00:39,009
Well, she's moving away.

803
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:41,810
I'm never going to see her again.

804
01:00:45,559 --> 01:00:47,646
Is there anything I could do to help?

805
01:00:48,228 --> 01:00:51,775
Aw, I don't... I don't think so, sweetheart.

806
01:00:52,816 --> 01:00:55,615
Well, is there anything you could do?

807
01:00:57,153 --> 01:00:59,947
Hello, Lucy. This is Gru.

808
01:00:59,948 --> 01:01:02,629
I know up to this point our relationship

809
01:01:02,784 --> 01:01:05,536
has been strictly professional,

810
01:01:05,537 --> 01:01:09,843
and you're leaving for Australia and all, but...

811
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,049
Okay, here is the question.

812
01:01:13,211 --> 01:01:14,801
Would you like to...

813
01:01:16,172 --> 01:01:19,435
to go out on a date?

814
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:21,683
Uh, no.

815
01:01:22,053 --> 01:01:24,096
Okay, that's not helping.

816
01:01:24,097 --> 01:01:27,063
All right, here we go. For real this time.

817
01:01:37,027 --> 01:01:38,368
I can do this.

818
01:01:57,088 --> 01:01:58,299
Agh! I hate you!

819
01:02:02,177 --> 01:02:03,221
Ah.

820
01:02:04,177 --> 01:02:06,221
火警

821
01:02:58,566 --> 01:02:59,610
Eh.

822
01:03:00,902 --> 01:03:02,528
- Kevin?  - Mmm?

823
01:03:02,529 --> 01:03:03,904
Tom?

824
01:03:03,905 --> 01:03:04,997
Hello!

825
01:03:05,573 --> 01:03:07,408
- Kampai!  - Kampai!

826
01:03:07,409 --> 01:03:08,619
Huh? Kampai!

827
01:03:28,972 --> 01:03:32,270
Cinco de May-ya-yo! Cinco de May-ya-yo!

828
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:44,490
This place is awesome!

829
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:49,158
Okay. Let's party, huh?

830
01:03:49,159 --> 01:03:51,952
But first, let's go over the rules.

831
01:03:51,953 --> 01:03:55,289
Because what is fun without the rules?

832
01:03:55,290 --> 01:03:57,010
Agnes, easy on the churros.

833
01:03:57,292 --> 01:03:59,178
- Edith, try not to kill anyone.  - Hai!

834
01:03:59,544 --> 01:04:00,794
Margo!

835
01:04:00,795 --> 01:04:01,922
Hello, Mr. Gru.

836
01:04:02,088 --> 01:04:03,381
Okay.

837
01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:05,009
Gru!

838
01:04:05,175 --> 01:04:10,095
There must be the standard 6 feet of space between you and boys.

839
01:04:10,096 --> 01:04:12,014
Especially this boy.

840
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:15,023
Ah, you are a funny man.

841
01:04:15,185 --> 01:04:17,949
There are no rules, se?or. It's Cinco de Mayo.

842
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:20,439
Come on! They're starting the dance!

843
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:21,947
Arriba!

844
01:05:18,790 --> 01:05:23,547
So glad you could make it, mi compadre.

845
01:05:24,087 --> 01:05:25,546
Hey, what's wrong?

846
01:05:25,547 --> 01:05:27,631
Oh, nothing. Nothing is wrong.

847
01:05:27,632 --> 01:05:32,389
I'm just chilling with the guac, from my chip hat.

848
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:38,767
Gru, please. I know that look all too well.

849
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:41,270
It is the look of a broken heart.

850
01:05:41,271 --> 01:05:42,688
How did you know?

851
01:05:42,689 --> 01:05:46,275
Believe me, my friend, I too have spent many nights

852
01:05:46,276 --> 01:05:49,953
trying to drown my sorrows in guacamole.

853
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:52,367
- You?  - Yes.

854
01:05:53,074 --> 01:05:56,088
But we are survivors.

855
01:05:56,244 --> 01:06:00,337
There's much more to us than meets the eye.

856
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:02,879
Enjoy the party.

857
01:07:42,016 --> 01:07:43,274
Say what?

858
01:07:56,406 --> 01:07:59,324
Would you like some peanuts or pretzels?

859
01:08:03,955 --> 01:08:05,794
That's a good joke.

860
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:12,220
I just did a boom boom.

861
01:08:13,798 --> 01:08:16,017
I really need you to make a choice, hon.

862
01:08:17,552 --> 01:08:19,058
I choose Gru.

863
01:08:19,846 --> 01:08:21,898
I choose Gru!

864
01:08:25,601 --> 01:08:27,488
Thank you, Gru stewardess!

865
01:08:27,645 --> 01:08:29,318
You're welcome!

866
01:09:03,014 --> 01:09:06,516
You have not lost your touch, my friend.

867
01:09:06,517 --> 01:09:08,894
Ah-ha! I knew it!

868
01:09:08,895 --> 01:09:10,485
You are El Macho!

869
01:09:10,646 --> 01:09:12,782
That's right!

870
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:14,691
Nobody believed me!

871
01:09:14,692 --> 01:09:16,610
Ho-ho! But I knew you weren't dead!

872
01:09:17,779 --> 01:09:21,409
Of course not. I merely faked my death.

873
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:24,493
But now, it's time for me

874
01:09:24,494 --> 01:09:28,456
to make a spectacular return to evil.

875
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:34,419
Doctor, I think it's time we showed Gru what we're up to here.

876
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:36,588
Dr. Nefario?

877
01:09:36,589 --> 01:09:38,760
Nice to see you, Gru.

878
01:09:39,425 --> 01:09:40,550
Wha...?

879
01:09:40,551 --> 01:09:43,637
So, this is your new job opportunity?

880
01:09:43,638 --> 01:09:46,603
Absolutely. You're gonna like this.

881
01:09:51,646 --> 01:09:52,773
Sorry.

882
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:56,694
I had to borrow some of your minions, but it was for a worthy cause.

883
01:09:57,151 --> 01:09:59,820
Oh! Kevin!

884
01:09:59,821 --> 01:10:02,289
No, he's not Kevin anymore.

885
01:10:02,448 --> 01:10:07,536
Now he is an indestructible, mindless killing machine!

886
01:10:08,871 --> 01:10:10,544
Just watch this.

887
01:10:25,304 --> 01:10:27,191
And here's the best part!

888
01:10:27,390 --> 01:10:30,569
I got an army of them!

889
01:10:31,936 --> 01:10:34,700
Look, look, look!

890
01:10:43,197 --> 01:10:47,242
Soon I will unleash them on the world,

891
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:51,413
and if anyone, anyone tries to stop them...

892
01:10:52,582 --> 01:10:55,132
Their city gets eaten!

893
01:10:55,710 --> 01:10:57,216
We can do it together.

894
01:10:57,462 --> 01:10:58,628
Together?

895
01:10:58,629 --> 01:10:59,673
Together!

896
01:11:00,214 --> 01:11:03,133
I have admired your work for years, amigo.

897
01:11:03,134 --> 01:11:06,636
Stealing the Moon! Are you kidding?

898
01:11:06,637 --> 01:11:08,892
We would be unstoppable!

899
01:11:09,056 --> 01:11:11,607
Men like you, men like me.

900
01:11:11,767 --> 01:11:15,860
We should be ruling the world!

901
01:11:16,022 --> 01:11:17,742
So, are you in?

902
01:11:20,067 --> 01:11:21,740
Uh, yeah, probably.

903
01:11:22,153 --> 01:11:23,363
Probably?

904
01:11:23,529 --> 01:11:26,239
I mean, yes, yes! Of course, yes.

905
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:29,117
I just have a lot going on right now.

906
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:31,953
I just need to get some things off my plate

907
01:11:31,954 --> 01:11:35,252
before we start taking over the world, that's all.

908
01:11:35,458 --> 01:11:37,261
- Excuse me?  - No, forget it.

909
01:11:37,460 --> 01:11:40,592
One hundred percent! I am in!

910
01:11:40,755 --> 01:11:43,924
I think... Do you hear that? I do.

911
01:11:43,925 --> 01:11:47,555
That's Agnes calling me from on the surface.

912
01:11:50,389 --> 01:11:51,861
Totally in!

913
01:11:53,726 --> 01:11:55,018
You know what?

914
01:11:55,019 --> 01:11:57,569
I am not so convinced that he is in.

915
01:12:09,408 --> 01:12:11,493
Edith, Agnes, come on! Ooh!

916
01:12:11,494 --> 01:12:12,661
Oops, sorry.

917
01:12:12,662 --> 01:12:14,412
We need to go home now. Where is Margo?

918
01:12:14,413 --> 01:12:16,050
But I didn't get a turn!

919
01:12:22,713 --> 01:12:23,757
Margo!

920
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:26,178
Come on. We're leaving...

921
01:12:26,509 --> 01:12:28,134
Hey, what's wrong?

922
01:12:28,135 --> 01:12:29,726
I hate boys.

923
01:12:33,057 --> 01:12:35,016
Yes. They stink.

924
01:12:35,017 --> 01:12:37,188
Uh, sorry. Honey, we got to go.

925
01:13:00,334 --> 01:13:01,841
Oops! Sorry.

926
01:13:13,389 --> 01:13:16,391
Hey! Pollito, what's the matter?

927
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:17,600
Oh, hey, Eduardo!

928
01:13:17,602 --> 01:13:19,519
Lucia, I apologize.

929
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:22,355
Pollito, he's usually not like this.

930
01:13:22,356 --> 01:13:27,031
The same thing happened the other day with Gru, and...

931
01:13:29,030 --> 01:13:33,700
Oh, well, speaking of Gru, um, have you seen him? I really need to talk to him.

932
01:13:33,701 --> 01:13:36,911
Yes. I think he's somewhere around here.

933
01:13:36,912 --> 01:13:38,834
You two are close, no?

934
01:13:39,165 --> 01:13:40,623
Oh, I don't know.

935
01:13:40,625 --> 01:13:44,044
I mean, "close," I wouldn't say we were close.

936
01:13:44,045 --> 01:13:46,129
Why, did he say we were close? Did he say that?

937
01:13:46,130 --> 01:13:48,715
It's more what he didn't say.

938
01:13:48,716 --> 01:13:52,135
For instance, he never mentioned

939
01:13:52,136 --> 01:13:55,268
that you were both working for the Anti-Villain League!

940
01:13:56,766 --> 01:13:58,224
You're coming with me.

941
01:13:58,225 --> 01:13:59,269
Hey!

942
01:14:00,561 --> 01:14:01,902
Crikey!

943
01:14:07,985 --> 01:14:10,528
So, Eduardo's actually El Macho?

944
01:14:10,529 --> 01:14:11,787
Cool!

945
01:14:11,947 --> 01:14:13,281
No, it is not cool!

946
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:15,742
Plus, I pretty much knew it was him all along,

947
01:14:15,743 --> 01:14:17,827
so if anyone's cool, it's me!

948
01:14:19,705 --> 01:14:20,914
Gru!

949
01:14:20,915 --> 01:14:23,041
Well, Dr. Nefario.

950
01:14:23,042 --> 01:14:25,877
El Macho's onto you. He knows you're working for the AVL.

951
01:14:25,878 --> 01:14:27,800
And he's got your partner.

952
01:14:28,381 --> 01:14:29,768
Lucy?

953
01:14:29,924 --> 01:14:33,218
That's impossible. She's on her way to Australia!

954
01:14:33,219 --> 01:14:34,427
Nefario?

955
01:14:34,428 --> 01:14:35,852
Sorry, gotta go!

956
01:14:37,556 --> 01:14:38,897
He's got Lucy?

957
01:14:40,017 --> 01:14:41,571
Not for long.

958
01:14:41,769 --> 01:14:44,154
Come on, we're getting her out of there.

959
01:16:12,777 --> 01:16:14,152
What was that?

960
01:16:25,915 --> 01:16:27,208
I don't see anything.

961
01:16:41,013 --> 01:16:42,354
Run!

962
01:16:42,890 --> 01:16:43,934
My unicorn!

963
01:16:44,058 --> 01:16:45,446
Agnes, no!

964
01:17:19,426 --> 01:17:21,182
Come on! Hurry!

965
01:17:24,598 --> 01:17:25,856
What's the matter?

966
01:17:46,954 --> 01:17:48,246
Kevin!

967
01:17:50,833 --> 01:17:52,505
Dr. Nefario! You're back!

968
01:17:52,835 --> 01:17:54,306
In the flesh.

969
01:17:55,337 --> 01:17:57,556
Behold, the antidote.

970
01:18:01,010 --> 01:18:04,890
Come on. Let's finally put this horrible jelly to some good use.

971
01:18:20,112 --> 01:18:23,042
Hey, guys, come on! Stay focused here.

972
01:19:05,032 --> 01:19:07,582
Curses! Foiled again!

973
01:19:07,743 --> 01:19:10,247
These guys captured me!

974
01:19:49,034 --> 01:19:50,078
Run!

975
01:19:59,169 --> 01:20:00,462
Up that tree!

976
01:20:01,672 --> 01:20:02,882
Hurry! Hurry!

977
01:21:04,068 --> 01:21:05,818
Hello, Gru!

978
01:21:05,819 --> 01:21:09,082
Hey hey! Nice work, Dr. Nefario!

979
01:21:09,406 --> 01:21:11,411
I put an antidote in the jelly.

980
01:21:11,909 --> 01:21:15,953
I mean, I'm happy to create an evil army to destroy the world,

981
01:21:15,954 --> 01:21:18,754
but nobody messes with my family.

982
01:21:18,916 --> 01:21:20,802
Thank you, Doctor.

983
01:21:20,959 --> 01:21:22,846
Now, let's go get the...

984
01:21:24,171 --> 01:21:25,298
Hi!

985
01:21:25,464 --> 01:21:26,757
You brought the girls?

986
01:21:26,924 --> 01:21:28,217
Yes!

987
01:21:29,635 --> 01:21:31,106
Was that wrong?

988
01:21:41,146 --> 01:21:43,731
What's happening to my minions?

989
01:21:43,732 --> 01:21:44,859
Gru?

990
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:49,654
You guys, take care of the rest of the minions.

991
01:21:49,655 --> 01:21:51,660
I'm going to find Lucy.

992
01:22:01,875 --> 01:22:04,593
Eat jelly, you purple freaks!

993
01:22:34,074 --> 01:22:35,741
It's over, El Macho.

994
01:22:35,742 --> 01:22:37,130
Now, where is Lucy?

995
01:22:38,495 --> 01:22:39,788
Let me show you.

996
01:22:52,384 --> 01:22:53,968
Oh, hey, Gru!

997
01:22:53,969 --> 01:22:57,555
Turns out you were right about the whole El Macho thing, huh?

998
01:22:57,556 --> 01:22:58,897
Yay!

999
01:22:59,308 --> 01:23:03,060
One push of this button, and I send that rocket

1000
01:23:03,061 --> 01:23:07,565
straight into the same volcano where I faked my death.

1001
01:23:07,566 --> 01:23:10,568
Only this time, it's for real.

1002
01:23:10,569 --> 01:23:11,613
No!

1003
01:23:21,955 --> 01:23:25,633
We could have ruled the world together, Gru!

1004
01:23:26,168 --> 01:23:27,556
But now,

1005
01:23:27,961 --> 01:23:29,634
you're gonna die.

1006
01:24:42,452 --> 01:24:44,912
Mmm, lipstick taser!

1007
01:24:44,913 --> 01:24:47,132
Aw, he copied me.

1008
01:24:53,380 --> 01:24:57,758
I am not afraid of your jelly guns.

1009
01:24:57,759 --> 01:25:01,220
Oh, this ain't a jelly gun, sunshine.

1010
01:25:15,277 --> 01:25:17,445
Don't worry about me, Gru, I'll be fine.

1011
01:25:17,446 --> 01:25:19,989
I have survived lots worse than this.

1012
01:25:19,990 --> 01:25:21,662
Okay, that's not entirely true.

1013
01:25:21,825 --> 01:25:23,576
I'm actually kind of freaking out up here!

1014
01:25:23,577 --> 01:25:25,664
Don't worry, I will get you out of this.

1015
01:25:34,212 --> 01:25:36,383
I really hate that chicken.

1016
01:26:01,573 --> 01:26:03,658
Is there a red one? It's usually the red one!

1017
01:26:06,161 --> 01:26:08,842
Gru, anytime now!

1018
01:26:10,540 --> 01:26:13,334
Listen, Lucy, we may not get out of this alive,

1019
01:26:13,335 --> 01:26:15,711
so I need to ask you a question.

1020
01:26:15,712 --> 01:26:16,804
Uh, better make it quick.

1021
01:26:17,297 --> 01:26:20,726
If I had asked you out on a date, what would you have said?

1022
01:26:21,176 --> 01:26:22,510
Are you kidding me?

1023
01:26:22,511 --> 01:26:23,554
Yes!

1024
01:26:25,764 --> 01:26:26,938
Jump!

1025
01:26:39,569 --> 01:26:41,041
Lucy!

1026
01:26:41,696 --> 01:26:43,915
Lucy, where are you?

1027
01:26:47,202 --> 01:26:48,413
Oh, Lucy!

1028
01:26:49,121 --> 01:26:50,295
Gru!

1029
01:26:54,376 --> 01:26:58,137
Sorry! I guess you need your arms to tread water, huh?

1030
01:27:06,721 --> 01:27:08,359
They'll be back.

1031
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:13,000
147次约会后

1032
01:28:19,794 --> 01:28:23,009
Can I be the first to say, "Ew!"

1033
01:28:42,234 --> 01:28:43,325
Okay.

1034
01:28:44,486 --> 01:28:45,743
Excuse me.

1035
01:28:47,614 --> 01:28:49,500
Um, hi, excuse me.

1036
01:28:58,750 --> 01:29:02,511
Hi, everybody. I'd like to make some toast.

1037
01:29:04,839 --> 01:29:06,263
Okay.

1038
01:29:07,550 --> 01:29:08,842
She, um...

1039
01:29:08,843 --> 01:29:13,103
She kisses my boo-boos, she braids my hair.

1040
01:29:13,223 --> 01:29:16,070
We love you, mothers, everywhere.

1041
01:29:16,559 --> 01:29:19,906
And my new mom, Lucy, is beyond compare.

1042
01:29:29,489 --> 01:29:31,577
To the bride and Gru!

1043
01:30:04,983 --> 01:30:07,533
Woo-hoo! I'm so happy!

1044
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,992
不要走开 精彩继续
